# ðŸŒŠ Pulsating 3D Sine-Wave
* The 3D structure pulsates uniformly relative to the object's center point
* There are four sliders which provide custom control
  * The first slider controls the rate of pulsation
  * The second slider controls the average height of the blocks
  * The third slider controls the camera angle
  * The fourth slider controls the camera zoom
* The 3D sine wave is illuminated by blue and red point light sources and a directional light source
* The colored confetti falls downwards and rotates at different angles, and resets at the top
